# Wannaroo Bridges

NewGRF for OpenTTD - Default bridges with modified lengths, speeds.

1. About

    Sometimes the default bridges are all you want, but when starting an early game, the defaults make me sad. Some bridges can now be longer and faster. I'm releasing this newgrf into the wild in case others find it useful.

1. Compatibility

    Wannaroo Bridges should be compatible with other newgrfs, but the usual caveats apply:

    Compatibility with any newgrf is not guaranteed. No warranties are expressed or implied.

    Requirements: OpenTTD 1.2.0 or later.
